# no-mouse
made a few apps to practice c

movemouse allows for controlling the cursor via the keyboard\
binds:\
  h - left\
  j - down\
  k - up\
  l - right\
  a - speed 1\
  s - speed 2\
  d - speed 3\
  f - speed 4\
  c - left click\
  r - right click\
  Scr_Lock - toggle normal and mouse mode\
  Pause/Break - kills the app

intercept just types normally until Scr_Lock is pressed, then it types in a weird to cyrillic conversion (thats how i type)\
pause/break to stop
